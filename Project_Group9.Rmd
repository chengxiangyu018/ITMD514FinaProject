# Dataset Description **by Wen**

The dataset we will be using is the SkillCraft1 Master Table Dataset Data Set from the University of California, Irvine Machine Learning Repository dated on September 20th, 2013.

Data is available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SkillCraft1+Master+Table+Dataset

The dataset consists of the following attributes:

GapBetweenPACs        | Mean duration in milliseconds between PACs (continuous)
ActionLatency         | Mean latency from the onset of a PACs to their first action in milliseconds (continuous)
ActionsInPAC          | Mean number of actions within each PAC (continuous)
TotalMapExplored      | The number of 24x24 game coordinate grids viewed by the player per timestamp (continuous)

The results showed that in order to improve the game level, attacks through APM, mini-maps, UniqueHotkey usage, and importantly, practice increasing the number of times you look at the map.



Data Analysis
Hypothesis Testing

**BY Ming**

> Hypothesis Testing: Null Hypothesis is:The mean of ActionLatency from low and high APM group have no difference.
Alternate Hypothesis is:The mean of ActionLatency from  low and high APM group have difference.
The hypotheis test is:
H0:μlowAPM=μhighAPM,H1:μlowAPM≠μhighAPM.
We assume the two population follow normal distribution but both population variance are unknown.So we firstly use f-test to check if the variance from two population are equal or not.

```{r}
# assume the α=0.05.
str(treatedLatencyData)
lowAPMActionLatency<-treatedLatencyData[treatedLatencyData$APMGroup=="low APM",]$ActionLatency
highAPMActionLatency<-treatedLatencyData[treatedLatencyData$APMGroup=="high APM",]$ActionLatency

```

>Check if their variance are equal or not. The hypotheis test for variance is:
H0:σ2lowAPM/σ2highAPM=1,H1:σ2lowAPM/σ2highAPM≠1.
We use f-test to check the result.

```{r}
var.test(lowAPMActionLatency,highAPMActionLatency,alternative = c("two.sided"),conf.level = 0.95)

```

>Base on the result of f-test, the p-value < α, so we should reject H0.And the 95 percent confidence interval is between 1.287094 and 1.565752. So 1 is not within it,it also support the variance of two populaton are not equal. 
Then we check the mean difference by utilizing t-test

```{r}
t.test(lowAPMActionLatency,highAPMActionLatency,alternative = "two.sided",var.equal = FALSE, conf.level = .95)

```

>Base on the result of t-test, the p-value  < α, so we should reject H0.And the 95 percent confidence interval is between 21.57640 and 23.30364.So 0 is not within it,it also support the mean of two populaton are not equal. 
We als have sufficient statistical evidence to prove that low Apm Group has much higher ActionLatency than high Apm Group, they differnce between 21.57640 and 23.30364 in average in 95 percent confidence interval.

>Hypothesis h0:varianceBronzePACs = varianceGrandMasterPACs h1: varianceBronzePACs!=varianceGrandMasterPACs
The F-test's p-value is 0.7914>0.05,so base on alpha =0.05,we should not reject h0.

>The most significant factors are ActionLatency,AssignToHotkeys,MinimapAttacks,GapBetweenPACs,SelectByHotkeys,WorkersMade,NumberOfPACs and HoursPerWeek due to their p-value  are close to zero.Then We know those are the main factors to determine if players can play well or not.The age,APM and ComplexUnitsMade are not the significant factors due to their p-value are not small which unexpected by many people.So If you want to be a good skillCraft player,you have to find the right way to improve according to this analytical model.

> Base on the model we get,we can see the value for  Multiple R-squared, Adjusted R-squared,p-value, Residual standard error,MAE,MSE. But We can't judage if this model is the best or not.So we need compare with another model we select.

```

>Compare the two model by R-squared,Residual standard error,MAE,MSE.To determine best factor,the model need the  following criterias:
1.The model has the highest value of R-Squared and Adjusted R-Squared which can close to 1.
2.The model has the lowest value of RSE,MAE,MSE
So finally we choose the model from Subset Selection: LeagueIndex ~ ActionLatency + AssignToHotkeys +MinimapAttacks + GapBetweenPACs + WorkersMade + SelectByHotkeys +UniqueHotkeys + HoursPerWeek + NumberOfPACs + TotalMapExplored +Age

```{r}

IndexModel<-lm(formula = LeagueIndex ~ ActionLatency + AssignToHotkeys +MinimapAttacks + GapBetweenPACs + WorkersMade + SelectByHotkeys +UniqueHotkeys + HoursPerWeek + NumberOfPACs + TotalMapExplored +Age , data = Training)

par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(IndexModel)

```


> By assessing model fit,the previous Model which takes LeagueIndex as reponse seems don't fit very well.Multiple R-squared and Adjusted R-squared are not very close to 1.We know R2 measures the proportion of variability in Y that can be explained using X.In general,it's better to close to 1.

> How about take APM as response? The previous Linear Model's response is LeagueIndex,it is better to consider as Categorical attribute.

# The most significant factors are SelectByHotkeys,MinimapRightClicks,NumberOfPACs,ActionLatency,ActionsInPAC,WorkersMade,ComplexAbilitiesUsed due to their p-value are close to zero.It shows that if game player want to improve APM they should have strong the game operative skills with mouse and keyboard and reduce the gap and Latency.

APMModel<-lm(formula = APM ~ SelectByHotkeys + ActionLatency + ActionsInPAC + NumberOfPACs + WorkersMade + MinimapRightClicks + ComplexAbilitiesUsed + MinimapAttacks + UniqueUnitsMade + Age + UniqueHotkeys + LeagueIndex  , data = Training)
plot(APMModel)

# Comparing the two model with different response by Multiple R-squared and Adjusted R-squared to assess model fit.The APM model's Multiple R-squared and Adjusted R-squared are much more close to 1 than LeagueIndex Model's . 
# So the APM model is a better model.

>Goodness of fit test **BY Ming**

```{r}

#  Independence of Age and APM.
# assume  α=0.05
#  H0: (null hypothesis) The Age and APM are independent.
#  H1: (alternative hypothesis) The  Age and APM are dependent.

a1 = nrow(treatedLatencyData[treatedLatencyData$AgeGroup=="old" | treatedLatencyData$APMGroup=="high APM",])
a2 = nrow(treatedLatencyData[treatedLatencyData$AgeGroup=="young"  | treatedLatencyData$APMGroup=="high APM",])
b1 = nrow(treatedLatencyData[treatedLatencyData$AgeGroup=="old" | treatedLatencyData$APMGroup=="low APM",])
b2 = nrow(treatedLatencyData[treatedLatencyData$AgeGroup=="young"  | treatedLatencyData$APMGroup=="low APM",])

LevelTable<-rbind(c(a1,a2),c(b1,b2))
dimnames(LevelTable) <- list(
  AgeGeneration = c("Old", "Young"), 
  APMLevel = c("High APM","Low APM"))

LevelTable


# display the proportion
prop.table(LevelTable)

# chi-square test
chisq.test(LevelTable)

# prop test
prop.test(LevelTable)

# due to p value(2.2e-16) is less than 0.05, we should reject H0.We can conclude that Age and APM are two dependent variables.


# We all hear about that if you want to be a good skillCraft player,you have to increase the APM,and the age could effect the APM value. Yes,We approve that base on this Independence test for Age and APM. But our previous assessment  on Multiple Linear Regression by Subsect Selection also shows that Age and APM are not the only significant factors to LeagueIndex.Sure,the model is not fit very well. But The players could take considetation to focus more on tactics and technology such as SelectByHotkeys, AssignToHotkeys,MinimapAttacks,WorkersMade,NumberOfPACs.Those factors can both improve your LeagueIndex and APM.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
